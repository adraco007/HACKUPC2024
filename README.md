Image Computing for an Ecommerce
Given a dataset of garment images from various angles, the challenge is to develop an algorithm that identifies duplicated or very similar images not belonging to the same set (each set consists of three consecutive photos). This involves comparing colors, features, and bitmaps.

The task is computationally intensive, requiring over 8 billion computations due to the combinatorial complexity of image comparisons in three dimensions.

The algorithm's accuracy and speed will be key evaluation criteria. Advanced teams may use provided photos to create a website showcasing their work. Senior teams could infer garment details (year, season, indicators) from generated URLs.
